## 4. Required Auditor Artifacts

The following must be provided to the audit firm before engagement begins:

- [ ] Final WASM binaries (reproducible build via `make build`)
- [ ] Git commit hash of audited revision
- [ ] Dependency tree (`cargo tree`)
- [ ] `cargo audit` output (zero high/critical findings)
- [ ] Completed `docs/security/audit-scope.md`
- [ ] Access to this repository (read-only)
- [ ] Contact for technical questions during the audit

## 5. Known Risks & Remediation Priorities

| Risk | Severity | Remediation | Status |
|------|----------|-------------|--------|
| `restrict_admin_vote` semantics ambiguity | Low | Documented in ADR-007, behaviour locked | ✅ Resolved |
| Off-chain notification service has no RBAC | Low | See issue [#368](https://github.com/mercyJJ/cosmosvote/issues/368) | ⬜ In Progress |
| No on-chain upgrade path | Informational | Accepted — immutable contracts by design | ✅ Accepted |
| Token balance used as live voting weight (no snapshot) | Low | Accepted risk — documented in ADR-003 | ✅ Accepted |
| Frontend XSS surface (wallet message display) | Low | Sanitization documented in `docs/wallet-message-sanitization.md` | ✅ Resolved |
